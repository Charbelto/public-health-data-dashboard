# Public Health Data Insights Dashboard

This project is a command-line Python tool to explore public health datasets
(e.g. vaccination rates, disease outbreaks, or mental health reports).

## Aim

- Load public health data from CSV and/or a public API into a local database.
- Clean and structure the data (handle missing values, convert types).
- Provide filtering and summary views (e.g. by country, date range, age group).
- Present results as tables and charts.

## Core Features (planned)

- Data access and loading into a database.
- Data cleaning (missing values, type conversions).
- Filtering by user-selected criteria.
- Summary statistics (mean, min, max, counts).
- Trend analysis over time.
- Simple command-line interface (CLI).
- Visualisations with Matplotlib.

## Development Notes

- Python 3.x
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) using `pytest`.
- Version control using Git and a private remote repository.
